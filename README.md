# FileShareExpress file sharing app apis

Building the 'FileShareXpress' app involves creating APIs using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The project covers file upload using Multer, integrating nodemailer for email notifications through a free SMTP service, and implementing Google authentication and Passport authentication with JWT.

'FileShareXpress' will be deployed on Heroku, providing a live server environment. The project also includes a scheduled script to automatically delete files older than 24 hours from storage. Users will receive email links for easy file downloads, enhancing the app's usability.
